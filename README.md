Spreadsheet for estimating scholarship grants
## Instructions
* Under the Starting, or initial values, column:
** Enter the starting date
** Enter the starting Endowment amount
** Enter the Estimated Yearly costs for college, tuition and expenses.
** Enter the % amount to grant for the scholarship, based off of Yearly costs.
** Enter Guestimates for return on investment % year over year, and for yearly costs collget increase.
** Optionally determine the rounding of the scholarship, initally set to currently lower of nearest 500.

## Once a year, on the year's row, update the actual amounts obtained.
* Under the <B>Actual Scholarship</B> column, enter the ammount for the granted scholarship
* Under the <B>Actual Costs For Year</B> column, enter the amount for the average costs for a year of college.
* Under the <B>% Inflation</B> column, enter the amount of inflation for the year. This may be extended into future years if needed.
* Under the <B>Additional Contributions</B> column, adjust the net ammount of the Endowment +/- the difference between what's in the spreadsheet, and the actual endowment investements remaining. This would include the aggregate of all returns, and any additional gifts.

## Special notes
* <B>25 Year Warn====></B> The spreadsheet will highlight a warning, when it is estimated that there are only 25 years remaining from that point in time, before all funds are expended.
** This gives the opportunity to adjust, delay the scholarship, per instructions of the Endowment, to help extend its lifetime.
* The Recommended Scholarship column is a crude approximation for how to extend the life beyond 25 years. A better computation should be explored and replace this column.
* The notes column should be filled out with any additional addendum information, for relevent future reference.
* Note that the spreadsheet makes use of two types of references, one using named cell, the other using named column, e.g. @[Est Costs of College].
