# ScholarshipTemplate - inflation adjusting
This Spreadsheet is for auto-indexing scholarship grants as a percentage of the total expected yearly costs of college.
As college costs rise, the spreadsheet computes an equivalent increase for the scholarship, which allows for the grant amount to keep pace with inflation.
## Instructions
* Set up the following Beginning initial values:
  * Enter the <B>Start Year</B>
  * Enter the <B>Starting Scholarship Investment</B> endowment amount
  * Enter the <B>Estimated Yearly Costs</B> for college, tuition and expenses.
  * Enter the <B>Percent of Yearly Costs to Grant</B> amount--used to calculate the amount to grant for the scholarship, a percent derived from the Estimated Yearly Costs.
  * Enter Guestimates for % investment returns year over year, and for % yearly costs will increase by.
  * Optionally determine the rounding of the scholarship, initally set to currently lower of nearest 500.

## Once a year, on the year's row, update the actual amounts obtained.
* Under the <B>Actual Scholarship</B> column, enter the ammount for the granted scholarship
* Under the <B>Actual Costs For Year</B> column, enter the amount for the average costs for a year of college.
* Under the <B>% Inflation</B> column, enter the amount of inflation for the year. This may be extended into future years if needed.
* Under the <B>Additional Contributions</B> column, adjust the net ammount of the Endowment +/- the difference between what's in the spreadsheet, and the actual endowment investements remaining. This would include the aggregate of all returns, and any additional gifts.

## Special notes
* <B>25 Year Warn====></B> The spreadsheet will highlight a warning, when the Scholarship Grant amount will fall below the expected percent of Yearly College costs designated.
* The 25 Year Warn gives the opportunity to adjust, delay the scholarship, per instructions setup at the inception of the Endowment, which will help to extend its lifetime.
* If funds do expire, then <B>Last Year====></B> will be displayed on the last year of the scholarship.
* The Recommended Scholarship column is a crude approximation for how to extend the life beyond 25 years. A better computation should be explored and replace this column.
* The notes column should be filled out with any additional addendum information, for relevent future reference.
* Implementation Note: the spreadsheet makes use of two types of references, one using named cell, the other using named column, e.g. @[Est Costs of College].
